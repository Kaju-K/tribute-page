                    This website was made to say that we all should love Shakira and also go through some problems that she faced.

                <p>
                    If this smile is not enough for you than I'm a little bit worried. BUT, in case it's not, we are going through some FACTS and more smiles that WILL change your mind.

                    First of all, her musics are great and this is also another thing that should be enough. But not only this, she is also making some of her musics both in english and spanish as you can see in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weRHyjj34ZE" target="_blank">Whenever, Wherever</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8Rwz6zBJSE" target="_blank">Suerte</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3-GiVIE8gc" target="_blank">Gypsy</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL8-8badzks" target="_blank">Gitana</a>. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src="./images/fundacion-pies-descalzos.svg" alt="Barefoot Foundation logo" class="logo-fundacion">
                <p>
                    In 1997 Shakira founded a charity called <a href="https://fundacionpiesdescalzos.com/" target="_blank">Fundaci√≥n Pies Descalzos</a> (<a href="https://fundacionpiesdescalzos.com/en/" target="_blank">Barefoot Foundation</a>) with the aim of helping poor and impoverished children.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The foundation has five schools across Colombia that provide education and meals for 4000 children.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In 2016 on of these schools that is located in Barranquilla (the city where she was born) was <a href="https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2016/11/30/colegio-de-shakira-nombrado-la-mejor-institucion-publica-segun-nuevo-indice/" target="_blank">elected the best public school</a> (couldn't find some source in english, but I didn't search that much aswell :P) in Colombia and here you can see her reaction.
                </p>
                <br>
                <div class="video-fundacion-wrapper">

                <p>
                    For those who does not speak spanish, she is being awesome.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    For those who does not speak spanish and wants to know what she was saying, she was saying that she received and incredible news and wanted to make a pause during the shootings to celebrate that the school from the Barefoot Foundation was elected the best public school in Colombia. Basically: "Uhuuul, bravo, let's go!".
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Not only does she have this charity foundation but in 2011 <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-shakira-haiti-idINTRE72U7ZF20110331" target="_blank">Shakira donated $400,000 to rebuild a school for girls in Haiti</a> after the terrible earthquake that happened in 2010.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>So... Convinced already?</p>
                <br>
                <p class="reasons-no">NO???</p>
                <br>
                <p>Ok... Strange, but ok...</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The ultimatum is: she made the best song for the World Cup in 2010 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRpeEdMmmQ0" target="_blank">Waka Waka</a>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    "Oh, but the music from 2006 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTJSt4wP2ME" target="_blank">Wav...</a>" NO!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Ok, Ok, I'm kidding the song from 2006 was pretty good aswell but Waka Waka was better.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    And we can see how great she is by watching this video of the most influential female singers through 2004 to 2020
                </p>

                </div>
                <br>
                <p>We can see that she is for a long time in the top 12, remaining in the top 1 for some time and every 4 years she is coming back to the top 5 (World Cup years). In the end of these 16 years she was the 6th most searched female singer because she is awesome!</p>

                    Let's start by the less obvious people. Her hairdresser in Spain of years before 2015 and some waiter of La Sexta program.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Shakira is/was involved on a <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/celebrities/2022/09/17/6326185be2704e6fb48b456f.html">juridical problem with Spain regarding tax fraud</a>. Apparently she was saying that she was not staying enough days in the country to be considered as someone that should pay the taxes or she paid some amount and the government saying that should be more (it's already 4AM and I don't want to read much more about it, so that's what you'll get - you can read more in the link provided in the beginning of the paragraph or search for more). 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The government said that they have evidence that she was stating in Spain because they have the schedule of her hairdresser and some waiter of the La Sexta program said "She came here many times in 2012, 2013 and 2014, she is a woman who always smiles and took photos with the clients"...
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Yeah, sounds like a solid case. Really precise description from the waiter that tells the exact amount of days that Shakira was in Spain so she would have to pay the taxes.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    But again, I really haven't read much about it (actually very little), so I don't know what's the situation, but the point is that the hairdresser and the waiter should be defending Shakira. EVEN LYING IF NEEDED! (Just kidding, don't lie in the court guys).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Now let's talk about the one that shall not be named, the biggest enemy, the evil, the darkness in the wor... No wait, I watched Harry Potter recently, this text is for another website...
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Let's talk about the not so good guy that made the worst decision possible. Yes, exactly, Pique</p>
                <br>
                <img src="./images/pique.png" alt="Pique" class="pique-photo">
                <br>
                <p>
                    For those who are away from the world, and don't know what happend, Shakira and this guy were married for 11 years (since 2011 I think) and <a href="https://stylecaster.com/gerard-pique-cheat-shakira/" target="_blank">he CHEATED ON HER</a>.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    She found out about it because of some <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/hollywood-news/shakira-knew-gerard-pique-was-cheating-on-her-because-of-her-favourite-strawberry-jam-heres-how/" target="_blank">jam jar</a> that was stayng in the fridge. She loved that jam and pique never ate it before because he didn't like it.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    So whenever you see that the jam that only you eat is going missing, there is only one possible conclusion: <del>guests</del> CHEATING!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Never doubt the intuition of a woman. And well, not long later Pique was already seen with another woman. SHAME ON HIM!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    And for this she made a song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I25nV9hXGA" target="_blank">Te Felicito</a>. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    How could someone do something like this? Specially after she made almost an entire album for him: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPTn0QEhxds&list=OLAK5uy_mLAIIooZEcieJ0n0XKRm6fu-i0khGktBo&index=2" target="_blank">El Dorado</a>. This makes us question about love and trust in the world and how people take advantage of the good ones.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    But HOPE still remains in this world. Pique and his new girlfriend went to a restaurant and <a href="https://www.harpersbazaararabia.com/culture/celebrity/why-did-gerard-pique-and-clara-chia-were-kicked-out-of-a-restaurant" target="_blank">got kicked out of there</a> because the owner of the place is a Shakira fan one of the waiters was refusing to serve them. CORRECT.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    And also, one day Pique went to a stadium and the crowd around him <a href="started singing one of shakira's song right next to him">started singing one of shakira's song right next to him</a> (could only find the article in portuguese) and he gets embarrassed. You can check the video below:
